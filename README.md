This is an OpenSCAD script for generating a hinged box, with rounded
corners, lid, interlocking rims, snap fit, magnet, or screw
closures, and easy places for adding cutouts or additions to any
face. All features are optional and specified by defining a few simple
variables. Additionaly a dovetail shape is provided to make boxes that
interlock with each other.

We've tried to make this useable for those less comfortable with or even
new to OpenSCAD. See the "Let's Build a Bee Box" tutorial:

[LETSBUILD-beebox.md](LETSBUILD-beebox.md).

please (Paypal shows SovereignIT, that is indeed us). We've got a
large collection of mouths to feed and your generous donations may
help me convince my wife that losing me to a coding project for the last
month was worthwhile.
