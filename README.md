This is an OpenSCAD script for generating a hinged box, with rounded
corners, lid, interlocking rims, snap fit, magnet, or screw closures,
and easy places for adding cutouts or additions to any face. All
features are optional and specified by defining a few simple
variables. Included utility functions make perforations, text and
image decorations possible in a single line of code. Additionaly a
dovetail shape is provided to make boxes that interlock with each
other.

We've tried to make this useable for those less comfortable with or even
new to OpenSCAD. See the "Let's Build a Bee Box" tutorial: [LETSBUILD-beebox.md](LETSBUILD-beebox.md).

Experienced OpenSCAD users may wish to skip straight to the
[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) file, or hacking at the included examples.

We've got a large collection of mouths to feed and your generous
donations may help me convince my lovely, loving, and patient wife
that losing me to a coding project for the last month was
worthwhile.
