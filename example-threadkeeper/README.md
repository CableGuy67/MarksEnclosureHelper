# Mark's Enclosure Helper - 4 Spool Thread Keeper

When we had this code almost useable, Marie bravely threw herself into
depths of OpenSCAD she had not yet explored and created this and the
[needlekeeper](../example-needlekeeper/) to see if someone else could
successfully create a box. She succeded.

This holds 4 spools of thread, with cutouts so you can see the colors.

The dragon is from the Welsh flag; she's been learning Welsh
recreationally for some time now. He's pretty enough to be seen more.

## Printing

We've printed this in PLA with a 0.6mm and a 0.4mm nozzle (earlier
prototype with different hinges). These boxes generally are easy to
print and should be very forgiving or errors. Supoports and print
cooling are not necessary but will enhance details.
